Ember JS: MVC in the browser tutorial
=====================================

Part 1 - routing
----------------

Here we look at the basic structure of an ember application, comparing it to a
basic rails one. We examine how routes are defined, how it differs to rails and 
how to examine them. See http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/blog/?p=46

Part 2 - templates
------------------

We add some templates for Posts index and each individual Post. We add a store,
a Post model and some fixtures data to render in the templates. We look at how
we get data from a store to a template via a route. See http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/blog/?p=75

Part 2 - nested resources
------------------

We create a comments model and routes and link it to the post model. We add routes, templates
and controller actions to create new comments
